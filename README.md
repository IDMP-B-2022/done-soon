# IDMP-B 2022
This repository contains the code for group D of the IDM project. In this project we attempt to develop a classifier for predicting whether the LCG solver `chuffed` will find a solution before a certain time limit. The paper can be found [here](example.com).

## Running Snakemake

In general, you can run the pipeline with the following command:

```bash
snakemake --cores N
```

Where `N` is the number of cores you want to use. This will run the pipeline from start to finish, generating all of the data and figures. 

### Partial data generation

If only a subset of the data has been generated, and you want to proceed from there, you can run the following command:

```bash
snakemake --touch --force -O solve_all_problems --cores N
```

Where `N` is the number of cores you want to use. This will run the pipeline until the `solve_all_problems` target, touching each one of the output files as if it was generated by the pipeline. This will allow you to run the pipeline from the `solve_all_problems` target onwards without actually finishing generating all of the data. This is useful if you have some number of problems that are still being solved, but you want to start working on the data that has already been generated.
